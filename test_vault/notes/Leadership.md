## Communicate intentions, next be explicit

In multiple leadership coaching sessions this week, we came to the topic of being explicit. So I decided to share the learning with all of you.  
  
In every relationship we have, it matters that we are explicit on:  
* what we want,  
* what we need,  
* what our intention is,  
* ...  
This takes away the need for assumptions in our partner.  
  
Becoming a leader brings about a multitude of new relationships e.g. with the people in your teams, stakeholders, ...  
  
A very important explicit statement to make as a leader:  
"My intention is ..."  
  
This way we create certainty, which leads to more psychological safety for our team members.  
  
If you want to find out more about your intentions as a leader, let me know how I can support you as coach!
