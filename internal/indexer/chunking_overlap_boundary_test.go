2. "Blue Ocean Strategy: How to Create Uncontested Market Space and Make Competition Irrelevant" by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne: This book introduces the concept of creating new market spaces rather than competing in existing ones.
3. "Good Strategy Bad Strategy: The Difference and Why It Matters" by Richard Rumelt: Rumelt provides insights into what makes a good strategy and how to distinguish it from ineffective approaches.
4. "The McKinsey Way" by Ethan M. Rasiel: This book provides an insiders perspective on the principles and strategies used by the renowned consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
5. "The Pyramid Principle: Logic in Writing and Thinking" by Barbara Minto: While not specifically about strategy, this book is highly recommended for consultants.
